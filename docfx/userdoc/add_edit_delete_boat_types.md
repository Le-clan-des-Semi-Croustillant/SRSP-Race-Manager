In **<span style="color: red"> part 1</span>** of the tab **Manage boat types**, it is possible to add boat types, just click on the button **Add new boat type** to create a boat. If you want to fill in additional data about this boat, you have to click on it, in this example you have to click on the **IMOCA** button.

We will then have the **<span style="color: green"> part 2</span>**, you can edit the characteristics of the boat gauges with the hull length, draft ... but you can also change the name of the boat type. Once you are done, you need to save the changes you made by clicking on the **Save** button. If instead you want to delete this boat, then you need to click on the **Delete** button to remove it from the list of existing boats (i.e. it will be deleted in the **<span style="color: red"> part 1</span>**.
  

Finally, after creating a boat type and filling in its gauge characteristics, you have the possibility to link it to one or more polars in the **<span style="color: yellow"> part 3</span>**. You just have to choose a name for the polar in the **Name** field, then upload it. You can also delete it via the little red cross in front of the polar.


>[!WARNING]
> Beware we do not check the integrity of the polar files you upload to the server, so if you want to upload images, erroneous polar files or viruses. On the side of the Race Manager, we will not be, it will be the Simple simulator that will have to handle these errors and this will cause an execution error.

>[!NOTE]
> It is possible that several polar files have the same name, since each polar file is identified by a unique ID. Thus the uniqueness of the files is not based on their names but on their respective IDs.
