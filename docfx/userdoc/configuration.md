From the **Configuration** tab, you can change the port number on which you want to connect to the server. You can also change the display language of the server, for the moment only English and French are supported.

We can also see from any page of the Race Manager if the server is on or off from **<span style="color: red"> part 1</span>**. We can also from the tab **Configuration** turn on or turn off the server remotely from **<span style="color: green"> part 2</span>**. This will automatically update the server status.
